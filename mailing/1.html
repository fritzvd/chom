    <p>Dear Cheeses of Mexico-fans,</p>
    <p>First of all, thank you for joining our mailing list!</p>
    <p>
      If you feel like you were tricked into this and want out you should
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0">unsubscribe!</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We won’t be sharing a lot on these mailing lists, because we know you
      already have full inboxes as it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, welcome! This is the first time we’re doing this kind of thing,
      but we feel like corporations that want us to make a lot of content are
      not really letting us get through to our fans anymore. Furthermore, how
      much fun is this? We can just exchange messages with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Writing this first mailing I found out that I already wrote a "first
      mailing", and just forgot to send it. The first mailing was about our
      previous single which was kind of a big deal for us, dealing with hope in
      the face of sadness.
    </p>

      Lastly, we just wanted to let you know that on the 21st of August we have
      a new EP coming out: my wraggies. The physical release will feature our
      entire catalogue, as a thank you for buying a physical copy.

      P.S. Sorry for the Rick Roll if you meant to unsubscribe, that was just
      juvenile. But if you really want out, just reply to this e-mail
